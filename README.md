# diamond
Scripts to help design a puzzle. May contain spoilers.

This program determines the number of arrangements that fit a set of criteria. There are two ways to define these arrangements:
 
- P(n): The set of tilings of 3n^2 60ยบ rhombuses that fill a regular hexagon.
- Q(n): The set of [polycubes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycube) that fit in a n^3 box with no overhangs in all 3 axial directions.

These two definitions are equivalent; an [isometric projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isometric_projection) of a valid polycube will always form a rhombuses-in-hexagon tiling, and vice versa.
