# diamond
Scripts to help design a puzzle. May contain spoilers.

This program determines the number of arrangements that fit a set of criteria. There are two ways to define these arrangements:
 
- P(n): The set of tilings of 3n^2 60ยบ rhombuses that fill a regular hexagon.
- Q(n): The set of polycubes that fit in a n^3 box with no overhangs in all 3 axial directions.

These two definitions are equivalent.
